# Introduction
Until now, you've been storing individual pieces of data, such as numbers or strings.
That works fine when you have just one or two pieces of data.
But what if you need to keep track of a list of items, like fruits, to buy? You might initially think of doing this:
<pre>
let fruit1 = "Apple";
let fruit2 = "Banana";
let fruit3 = "Orange";
let fruit4 = "Blueberry";
let fruit5 = "Cherry";
</pre>

Not only is this inefficient but imagine if you had 100 fruits! Would you create 100 variables? Of course not!
Wouldn't it be much better to keep all these related items in one single list—just like a proper shopping list?

That's where arrays come in.
In this chapter, you'll learn how to group and organize multiple values into a single variable using arrays.
Let's start by creating our first array.
