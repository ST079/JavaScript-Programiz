# Project Description
Suppose you're a teaching assistant at a university, and your task is to assign grades to students based on their average scores.

The grading rule is as follows:
Grade A: If the average score is equal to or above 80.
Grade B: If the average score is equal to or above 60 and less than 80.
Grade C: If the average score is equal to or above 50 and less than 60.
Grade F: If the average score is less than 50.

# Project Breakdown
This project has two distinct tasks:
Calculating the average marks
Calculating the grade
To accomplish these tasks, we'll create the following functions:

1. The getAverageScore() function

This function takes the student's scores as arguments, computes the average score, and returns it.

2. The computeGrade() function

This function takes the average score as an argument, computes the grade, and returns it.

With these things in mind, let's create our first function.
