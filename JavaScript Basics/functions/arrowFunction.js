Write a program to create an arrow function and perform multiplication.

The arrow function must take two parameters and return their product.
Create two variables a (which stores 10) and b (which stores 15).
Call the arrow function with the variables a and b, and display the result.

/*
Practice Problem Arrow Function

Write a program in arrow function format to add three numbers.
=> Define a function addThreeNums() which takes three parameters n1, n2, and n3.
=> Inside the function, find the sum of n1, n2, and n3 and store it in a variable.
=> Print the result inside the function.
